# Environmental Scientist and GIS Analyst
My background is primarily in environmental sciences, especially marine and estuarine sciences, with a focus on GIS. I aim to combine my scientific background with my skills in geospatial analysis. This webpage provides further information on my background and examples of some of the outcomes of the work I have done in GIS.

## Education
- M.S., Marine Science | University of North Carolina Wilmington (_May 2024_)
- B.A., Environmental Geoscience | The College of Wooster (_May 2021_)

## Projects
### 1. Heat Risk Index

   I calculated a heat risk index for the zip codes associated with Baltimore, MD to illustrate which parts of the city face the most risk associated with high temperatures. The initial index included only average high temperature, percent tree cover, and population density, but I am working to also incorporate demographic factors, such as percent of population over 65, as additional factors that contribute to higher risk from heat.

### 2. Thermal Imagery Map Produced with Drone-Collected Data

   In a graduate level class I took on drone applications, we traveled to the EV-Henwood Nature Preserve in North Carolina and flew a DUET-T Thermal camera aboard the eBeeX RTK drone. This drone and sensor collected both multispectral and thermal images, and I used these data to describe some site characteristics. I first calculated a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the sample area:

   I then used the thermal imagery collected by the drone to produce a map of the temperature range across the sample area:

### 3. Master's Thesis StoryMap

   In my master's thesis project, I used dendrochronology (the study of tree rings) to evaluate the impact of saltwater intrusion on bald cypress growth. To expand upon this research, I compared my sample locations to various remote sensing data and presented these findings in a [StoryMap](https://arcg.is/CLifK).
