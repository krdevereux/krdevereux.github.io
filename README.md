### Projects
I calculated a heat risk index for the zip codes associated with Baltimore, MD to illustrate which parts of the city face the most risk associated with high temperatures. The initial index included only average high temperature, percent tree cover, and population density, but I am working to also incorporate demographic factors, such as percent of population over 65, as additional factors that contribute to higher risk from heat.
