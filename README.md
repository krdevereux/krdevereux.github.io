# Environmental Scientist and GIS Analyst
My background is primarily in environmental sciences, especially marine and estuarine sciences, with a focus on GIS. I aim to combine my scientific background with my skills in geospatial analysis. This webpage provides further information on my background and examples of some of the outcomes of the work I have done in GIS.

## Projects
### Heat Risk Index

   I calculated a heat risk index for the zip codes associated with Baltimore, MD to illustrate which parts of the city face the most risk associated with high temperatures. The initial index included only average high temperature, percent tree cover, and population density, but I am working to also incorporate demographic factors, such as percent of population over 65, as additional factors that contribute to higher risk from heat.

### Storm Surge Inundation in Pamlico County, NC

   For this project, I was interested in the impacts of hurricanes on coastal North Carolina. I used the Sea Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model display program from NOAA to obtain flooding scenarios for different storm categories. I overlaid the results with Pamlico County data for building footprints to illustrate which structures would likely be inundated during different storm surge scenarios.

### Master's Thesis StoryMap

   In my master's thesis project, I used dendrochronology (the study of tree rings) to evaluate the impact of saltwater intrusion on bald cypress growth. To expand upon this research, I compared my sample locations to various remote sensing data and presented these findings in a [StoryMap](https://arcg.is/CLifK).

### Undergraduate Thesis Analysis of Precipitation Across the Continental US

   As a senior undergraduate student of environmental geosciences, I completed a year-long GIS thesis project in which I calculated different components of the water budget (precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration) in order to estimate groundwater recharge rates across the continental US (CONUS). Below is an example of one of these water budget components - precipitation. To calculation precipitation rates across the CONUS, I used data from the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University, which provides precipitation estimates at an 800m resolution for the 1981-2020 30-year normal. The precipitation component also included irrigation because, in certain parts of the CONUS, especially the drier West, irrigation contributes significantly to the water available for evapotranspiration, runoff, and recharge. Irrigation data by county came from the 2010 USGS Water Use data set (Maupin et al., 2014).

### Analysis of Chesapeake Bay Water Quality in Relation to Oyster Sanctuaries

   For an undergraduate GIS course final project, I was interested in exploring the spatial patterns of water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. I am highly interested in the restoration of the Bay and believe strongly in the importance of oysters in contributing to improved water quality. I therefore wanted to analyze water quality patterns as they relate to oyster sanctuary locations. My final poster demonstrated that the location of oyster sanctuaries did not have an impact on water quality trends, but that water quality across the Bay did improve over the study period. I combined the use of ArcGIS and R for these analyses.

### NDVI and Thermal Imagery Map Produced with Drone-Collected Data

   In a graduate level class I took on drone applications, we traveled to the EV-Henwood Nature Preserve in North Carolina and flew a DUET-T Thermal camera aboard the eBeeX RTK drone. This drone and sensor collected both multispectral and thermal images, and I used these data to describe some site characteristics. I first calculated a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the sample area:

   I then used the thermal imagery collected by the drone to produce a map of the temperature range across the sample area:
