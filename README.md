# Environmental Scientist and GIS Analyst
My background is primarily in environmental sciences, especially marine and estuarine sciences, with a focus on GIS. I aim to combine my scientific background with my skills in geospatial analysis. This webpage provides further information on my background and examples of some of the outcomes of the work I have done in GIS.

### Education
- M.S., Marine Science | University of North Carolina Wilmington (_May 2024_)
- B.A., Environmental Geoscience | The College of Wooster (_May 2021_)

### Projects
I calculated a heat risk index for the zip codes associated with Baltimore, MD to illustrate which parts of the city face the most risk associated with high temperatures. The initial index included only average high temperature, percent tree cover, and population density, but I am working to also incorporate demographic factors, such as percent of population over 65, as additional factors that contribute to higher risk from heat.
